Hi Professor,

I have added a username and password form to my existing static website. This is linked up with a database that stores the username and passwords entered.
I used apache24, mySQL and myPHPAdmin. PHP was used to create the interaction between the database and the username/password form. 

I could not find a free way to host this website on the internet so it is being run on my own local server that I created. 
I have attached screen shots showing the website, then a screen shot showing a username and password being entered and finally a screenshot of myPHPadmin where it shows
the username and password that was entered being stored into the database.
